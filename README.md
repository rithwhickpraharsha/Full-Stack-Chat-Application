# Full Stack Chat application

I have developed a Full Stack Web Application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack that allows users to send end-to-end messages online. The application also includes features such as displaying the status of users (whether they are online or offline), enabling users to share pictures and files, and providing additional details such as filtering users and displaying the timestamp of sent messages.

To accomplish this, I used MongoDB as the database to store user information, message data, and other relevant details. Express.js was employed as the backend framework to handle HTTP requests, manage routes, and interact with the database. On the frontend, I utilized React.js to build a user-friendly and responsive interface for sending and receiving messages, displaying user status, and facilitating file and picture sharing.

The application incorporates various functionalities, such as real-time updates to reflect users' online or offline status, ensuring that users can communicate seamlessly. It also includes features like filtering users based on specific criteria, making it easier for users to find and connect with specific individuals.

Additionally, the application maintains a timestamp for each sent message, providing users with the information on when a message was sent, improving the overall user experience.

Overall, this Full Stack Web Application built with the MERN stack offers a comprehensive messaging solution with additional features like status display, file sharing, and filtering, enhancing the user's messaging experience.
